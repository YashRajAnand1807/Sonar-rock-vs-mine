# Sonar Rock vs. Mine Detection Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Sonar Rock vs. Mine Detection Project! This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can distinguish between rocks and underwater mines using sonar data. This README file provides an overview of the project, its goals, and instructions for setting up and using the codebase.

## Project Description

Sonar technology is widely used for underwater exploration, including detecting underwater objects like rocks and potentially hazardous mines. This project focuses on building a machine learning model capable of differentiating between sonar signals reflected from rocks and those reflected from mines. The model uses a dataset of sonar readings to make these distinctions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can use this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn


You can install these packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

### Installation

1. Clone the project repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sonar-rock-vs-mine-detection.git
cd sonar-rock-vs-mine-detection
```

2. Download the dataset and place it in the `data` directory. You can obtain the dataset from [source-link](insert-source-link-here).

## Data

The dataset used for this project is stored in the `data` directory. It contains sonar readings from various angles and distances for both rocks and mines. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the required prerequisites and have installed the project as described in the Installation section.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd sonar-rock-vs-mine-detection
```

3. Run the script for sonar prediction:

```bash
python predict_sonar.py
```

This script will load the trained model and prompt you to enter sonar readings. It will then predict whether the object is a rock or a mine based on the input data.

## Model Training

If you wish to train your own model, you can use the provided Jupyter notebook in the `notebooks` directory. The notebook guides you through the data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation steps.

To open the notebook, run the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/Sonar_Rock_vs_Mine_Detection.ipynb
```
